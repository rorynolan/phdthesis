## Dimerization of FKBP12

Myristoylated FKBP12 is known to dimerize upon addition of the drug AP1510 [@Amara]. As a test application of exponential smoothing detrending (section \@ref(exponential-smoothing-detrending)) with automatically chosen parameter $\tau$, we used this system with number and brightness to verify this dimerization. We tested this in 20 Cos7 cells with mClover-labelled FKBP12. We found a brightness increase in $\epsilon$ of $\approx 1.6$-fold using the _automatic_ detrending method. The naiive choice of $\tau=10$ resulted in a $\approx 0.7$-fold calculated increase, which is indeed a decrease. The $\approx 1.6$-fold increase suggests that dimerization had occurred, however, we expected the increase to be $\approx 2$-fold upon dimerization. In that publication [@nandb], we postulated that the 1.6 figure was due to the fact that not all of the protein had dimerized. Recently, a paper came out [@fpcompare] explaining how the assumption that all fluorophores emit signal is invalid and that because of this, oligomeric state changes calculated from brightness must be adjusted by a correction factor specific to the fluorophore. Unfortunately, this study did not characterize mClover, so we do not know its correction factor. I suspect that applying this correction would bring our figure of 1.6 a lot closer to 2. We also tried the naive choice of $\tau=10$, which gave a decrease in brightness, showing that arbitrary parameter choices lead to unpredictable and unreliable results and should hence be avoided.


## _In vitro_ number and brightness

In our research group, we believe that the most practical quantitative method for measuring homo-dimerization _in vivo_ and _in vitro_ is N&B [@NB] because it is callibration-free and does not require specialised instrumentation. There are many examples of the application of N&B _in vivo_ (the original N&B paper has over 250 citations, most of which are _in vivo_ applications) but none _in vitro_. Hence, we published a protocol [@JOVE] detailing how N&B can be applied _in vitro_. This time, we used FKBP12F36V which is an FKBP mutant with a new dimerizing drug AP20187 (known coloquially as the _BB dimerizer_); this pair is designed to have better specificity than the original [@Clackson]. 

In this experiment, the FKBP12F36V was labelled with mVenus. We found that the brightness doubled from $\epsilon = 0.005$ to $\epsilon = 0.010$ upon addition of the drug. See figure \@ref(fig:jove). This analysis was done with exponential smoothing detrending with automatically chosen parameter $\tau$. Without detrending, the pre-BB brightness was calculated as $\epsilon = 0.026$, showing that detrending is absolutely necessary and that neglecting this step can lead to nonsensical results.

(ref:jove-caption) Dimerization of FKBP12F36V upon BB addition is seen by a brightness doubling from $\epsilon = 0.005$ to $\epsilon = 0.010$ over a period of minutes.

```{remark}

This paper also included an important correction to the equation for brightness $\epsilon$ when analog equipment is used. The correct equation is 

\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \frac{\sigma^2 - \sigma_0^2}{S(\langle I \rangle - \text{ offset})}
(\#eq:dalaleq)
\end{equation}
  
The $S$ in the denominator was omitted in the original paper [@Dalal] and this error was reproduced in our N&B review [@NBreview].

## HIV-1 receptor stoichiometry


### Introduction

Our main motivation for studying N&B in the first place was that we thought it was a valuable method to study the process of HIV-1 fusion in live cells. N&B was first used in our research group to study the oligomeric state of dynamin at the HIV-1 fusion pore in TZM-bl cells [@DanDynamin]. This study concluded that dynamin-2 stabilizes the HIV-1 fusion pore with a low oligomeric state.

Following on from this, we wanted to study the stoichiometry of the interaction of HIV-1 with its receptor (CD4) and co-receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) upon the engagement of the virus with the cell and to follow this interaction stoichiometry up to the point of fusion. See figure \@ref(fig:HIVStoichiometrySetup). See @Jakobsdottir for a review of HIV-1 fusion.

> Entry of HIV-1 into a host cell requires an initial interaction between the viral-envelope glycoprotein spike complex---Env---with cell surface displayed CD4 and co receptors [@Jakobsdottir]. Although structural studies have revealed the intra-molecular basis for CD4 receptor and CXCR4/CCR5 co-receptor-induced conformational changes to the HIV-1 Env during host cell entry [@Ozorowski], little is known about how the inter-molecular dynamics and stoichiometry of this process culminates in fusion with the host cell membrane in live cells [@Brandenberg]. This is due to the difficulty of working with live cells and the lack of temporal resolution of the techniques commonly employed (i.e. crystallography and cryo-EM).

(ref:HIVStoichiometrySetup-caption) The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein Env must bind the receptor (CD4) and form a complex with the co-receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5, this figure shows an X4-tropic virus and co-receptor) to initiate the fusion process. Labelling the viral Gag protein with mCherry, the receptor with mTFP1 and the co-recptor with mOrange, it is possible to follow these three players in the fusion reaction and to quantify their interaction.

```
We saw N&B as the ideal technique to probe this stoichiometry temporally. With our microscope, we could acquire 100 frames per 1.7 minutes, therefore, using each consecutive sequence of 100 frames to create a brightness image, we could obtain 1 brightness image every 1.7 minutes and use this to calculate this temporal stoichiometry.


### Expetimental setup

Receptor (mOrange) and co-receptor (mTFP1) were labelled in Cos7 cells. Virus was added at time $t=0$ and imaging proceeded for a number of minutes at 100 frames per 1.7 minutes. Alternating laser excitation (ALEX, @ALEX) was used to eliminate the possibility of channel bleed-through. See figure \@ref(fig:HIVStoichiometryIntensity).

(ref:HIVStoichiometryIntensity) Intensity images from the virus, receptor and co-receptor. Every 100th frame is shown. A virus which lands at $t \approx 1.7$ minutes is highlighted.

### Analysis

The virus channel was used to locate the virus at a given point in time. The receptor and co-receptor were used to calculate brightness and cross-correlated brightness every 100 frames (every 1.7 min). The brightness was used to determine the number of receptor and co-receptor units involved in a complex. The cross-correlated brightness was used to delimit whether or not the receptor and co-receptor units were together in the _same_ complex. See figure \@ref(fig:HIVStoichiometryAnalysis), this is the corresponding brightness and cross-correlated brightness image of figure \@ref(fig:HIVStoichiometryIntensity). Notice that once the virus lands, the oligomeric state of the receptor and co-receptor increases. We also see significant positive cross-correlated brightness in this area, indicating that the virus has triggered a complex of receptor and co-receptor.

### Results

Figure \@ref(fig:HIVStoichiometryPlots) shows the results of the analysis detailed in figures \@ref(fig:HIVStoichiometryIntensity) and \@ref(fig:HIVStoichiometryAnalysis) for $n=10$ cases where virus triggered receptor and co-receptor complexes in the X4-tropic setting and $n=12$ in the R5-tropic setting. A three-step pre-fusion process is hypothesized for each.

> Our studies support a dynamic three step model for both HIV~HXB2~ and HIV~JR-FL~ (figure \@ref(fig:HIVStoichiometryPlots)). For X4 tropic virions, Env – CD4 interactions induce CXCR4 dimerization, CD4 then engages with two Env, - as shown by 3 color TIRF-dSTORM microscopy - to generate a hexamer that might serve as a scaffold to stabilise a final 4CD4 – 1/2CXCR4 conformation, with a single Env. We speculate that for HIVHXB2, step 2 is crucial to culminate the fusion reaction and there could be an anchoring domain and a fusion domain that undergoes gp120 disassembly leading to 6 helix bundle formation. For R5 tropic virions, Env – CD4 interactions form a the previously described asymmetric pre-hairpin intermediate; following binding and oligomerisation of 2 additional CD4 molecules with concomitant CCR5 dimerization. After this, the secondary intermediate leads to the final fusion competent complex with a total of $4\pm0.3$ CD4, $2 \pm 0.3$ CCR5 and 1 JR-FL Env.

For the X4-tropic case, some structural modelling of the hypothesis has been done. See figure \@ref(fig:HIVStoichiometryStructure).

(ref:HIVStoichiometryStructure-caption) The HIV-1 JR-FL Env glycoprotein (Blue) (PDB ID: 4ZMJ) is present as a trimer on the  mature virion. STEP 1: The initial attachment of the cognate host receptor, CD4 (Orange) to HIV-1 Env (PDB: 5VN3) forms an asymmetric pre-hairpin intermediate. STEP 2: Subsequent binding and oligomerisation of additional CD4 molecules on the trimer forms the secondary intermediate. STEP 3: The formation of this penultimate intermediate allows binding and dimerization of CCR5 co-receptors (green) results in the final fusion competent complex, with a total of 4 CD4 and 2 CCR5 molecules bound to a single HIV-1 Env trimer. b, Time-resolved stoichiometry pre-fusion reaction for CXCR4-CD4 (red dots) induced by HIVHXB2–Gag-iCherry virions. The HIV-1 Env glycoprotein is present as a trimer on the mature virion. Cognate host receptors, CD4 and CXCR4, exist as monomers and dimers on the cell surface prior to receptor recognition. The gp120 and gp41 subunits of the Env spike are colored light and dark blue, respectively. CD4 is colored orange. Attachment of the HIV-1 Env spike induces the formation of CXCR4 dimers (STEP 1) also seen in the literature [@DoKwon]. CD4 clustering is likely facilitated by homodimerisation in the cytoplasmic domain, which enables cross-linking of at least two Env trimers (STEP 2) also seen in the literature [@Brandenberg2015]. Normal brightness analysis reveals the limited degradation of these higher order receptor clusters over time (2 – 5 mins). We hypothesize that 1 Env plays the role of the anchoring and signaling domain whilst the other constitutes the fusion domain. Disassembly of gp12042 in the fusion domain inciates the six helix bundle formation (STEP 3) and leads to the final 4CD4 – 2CXCR4 conformation in the anchoring domain. (gp120: light blue, gp41: dark blue, CD4: orange, CXCR4: green, b12: yellow)

### Conclusion

Time-resolved N&B enabled us to answer questions about the interaction between the HIV-1 virus and its receptor and co-receptor in live cells which up to now could not be answered. Being able to correctly correct for bleaching is crucial for reliable N&B analysis, so the development of these new algorithms was crucial to this study.
