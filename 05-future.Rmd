# Future plans


## Robin Hood publication

The _Robin Hood_ algorithm is already incorporated in the R package `detrendr` but it hasn't been published or peer-reviewed. Getting this done is my top priority.


## Translate software to _ImageJ_

Whilst I really like R, the fluorescence community does not use it, which has been a major barrier to the use of my algorithms. I will code my detrending algorithms as _ImageJ_ plugins (and perhaps also as python modules) so that more of the community have easy access to them.
