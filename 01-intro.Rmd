# Introduction {#intro}


## Fluorescence 

```{definition}
_Fluorescence_ is the emission of photons related to the process of _relaxation_ for a given molecule from an electronically _excited_ state (S~1~) to the _ground_ state (S~0~). 
```

These two electronic states (S~0~ and S~1~) of a molecule are defined as the highest occupied molecular orbital (S~0~, HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (S~1~, LUMO). Each electronic state has various associated _vibrational_ states between which _non-radiative_ transitions can occur. An electron can be _excited_ from the ground state S~0~ into the higher energy excited state S~1~ by absorption of a photon of the appropriate energy. The electron will remain in the excited state (possibly undergoing non-radiative transitions through vibrational states) for a period of nanoseconds before _relaxing_ to the lower energy ground state, losing energy by means of emitting a photon of that energy. This is shown by means of a _Jablonski_ diagram (figure \@ref(fig:Jablonski)).

```

```{definition}
The _fluorescence lifetime_ of an electron is the amount of time it remains in the excited state before returning to the ground state.
```

```{definition}
A _fluorophore_ is a fluorescent chemical compound that can re-emit light upon light excitation.
```

Fluorophores under constant excitation emit light one photon at a time according to Poisson statistics.


### Phosphorescence

```{definition}
Excited electrons can undergo a _forbidden_ transition into the _triplet_ state T~1~, where they remain for a period of milliseconds before relaxing to the ground state with the emission of a photon. This is _phosphorescence_.
```


### Photobleaching

In reality, an incident photon can _break_ the fluorophore such that it is unable to emit light. A fluorophore to which this has happened is said to be _photobleached_.


## Confocal light microscopy

All of the images used in my PhD were collected on a confocal microscope. This type of microscope guarantees that only in-focus light is collected at the detector. See figure \@ref(fig:confocal).

(ref:confocal-caption) Confocal microscope light path showing how out of focus light does not make it to the detector.^[Image courtesy of Quora: https://www.quora.com/How-does-confocal-microscopy-work]

```{r confocal, fig.cap='(ref:confocal-caption)', out.width='70%', echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("img", "quora_confocal.jpeg"))
```

```{definition}
The _confocal volume_ is the _in-focus_ volume within a sample that is efficiently detected using a system designed with confocal optics.^[Definition from http://www.fcsxpert.com/classroom/theory/what-is-confocal-volume.html.]
```

An image is acquired on a confocal microscope by scanning this apparatus across a sample, collecting one pixel at a time. 


### Detectors  {#detectors}

There are many types of confocal microscope detector. I will discuss the most common ones here. Most rely on the photoelectric effect [@photoelectric], a phenomenon whereby incident light upon a certain material causes electrons to dissociate from that material.

```{definition}
The _quantum efficiency_ of a detector is the fraction of fluorescent signal that is reported by the detector.
```

The quantum nature of the photoelectric effect makes it practically impossible for detectors to reach 100% efficiency.


#### Photon multiplier tubes

Photon multiplier tubes (PMTs) use the photoelectric effect. Dissociated electrons are accelerated through a potential difference towards a cathode where their accumulated kinetic energy is used to to release more electrons. These are then accelerated in vacuum towards another cathode and so on for a predefined number of these accelerations until at last the electrons are discharged into an anode where the current is measured [HammamatsuPMT]. See figure \@ref(fig:PMT). This current should correspond to the incident light intensity.

(ref:PMT-caption) PMT detector setup. Electrons are dissociated by photons at the photocathode, accelerated towards various other cathodes where more and more are freed and then finally they arrive at the anode where the current is measured [@LeicaDetectors].

```{r PMT, fig.cap='(ref:PMT-caption)', echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("img", "PMT.png"))
```

The quantum efficiency of standard PMTs is approximately 25% for blue-green light. This is because many incident photons on the multi-alkali material of regular PMT photocathodes fail to free any electrons. This problem gets worse at higher wavelengths where photons have lower energy. PMTs also suffer significantly from thermal noise (whereby dissociated electrons are created due to heat energy).


#### Avalanche photo-diodes

```{definition}
_Avalanche multiplication_ in semiconductors occurs when free electrons which are moving in an electric field across the semiconductor collide with bound electrons, freeing them to move and indeed to free more bound electrons. This compounding increase in free electrons in the electric field leads to an increase in the electric current.
```

Avalanche photo-diodes (APDs) are semiconductors that exploit the photoelectric effect together with avalanche multiplication (the photoelectric effect starts the avalanche) to convert light into measurable electric current. See figure \@ref(fig:APD). They are somewhat analogous to PMTs, using the avalanche effect in place of the series of cathodes. 

(ref:APD-caption) APD detector setup. The incident photon dissociates an electron. Given the electric field across the semiconductor this electron is accelerated, initiating an avalanche [@LeicaDetectors].

```{r APD, fig.cap='(ref:APD-caption)', echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("img", "APD.png"))
```

The quantum efficiency of APDs can be as high as 45%, however their dynamic range is low and they can only function with low-intensity light. APDs are less prone to thermal noise than PMTs.


#### Hybrid detectors {#HyDs}

APDs have better sensitivity and lower noise, however PMTs have a larger dynamic range. Hybrid detectors (HyDs) PMT and APD technology is combined to get the best of both worlds. With HyDs, photons are converted to electrons at the photocathode, then accelerated in vacuum towards a semiconductor where they initiate an electron avalanche. See figure \@ref(fig:HyD). The difference between HyDs and APDs is this acceleration step. 

(ref:HyD-caption) HyD detector setup. A photon dissociates an electron from the photocathode, this electron is then accelerated PMT-style towards an APD-style semiconductor setup, triggering an avalanche [@LeicaDetectors].

```{r HyD, fig.cap='(ref:HyD-caption)', echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("img", "HyD.png"))
```

HyDs with GaAsP photocathodes achieve a quantum efficiency of up to 50%. They also suffer least from detector afterpulsing, a phenomenon which can cause real signal pulses to be followed by a feedback pulse at a later time [@afterpulsing].

With their superior sensitivity and dynamic range and low noise, HyDs can be calibrated to enable _photon-counting_ mode whereby the readout is in units of photons (not electron current). This is a much more physically relevant readout, given that we are interested in measuring fluorescence, which is very convenient for many biological applications, not least fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS, discussed in section \@ref(FFS)).

```{remark}
Henceforth, intensity counts will be assumed to be in units of photons.
```


## Widefield light microscopy

With widefield microscopy, the entire sample is illuminated simultaneously and the image is acquired by a camera. See figure \@ref(fig:widefield). One advantage of this is the general simplicity of the setup: the optics are less complex and there is no need for scanning across the sample to acquire each pixel (which requires precise robotics). Another example is that images can be acquired faster because all pixels in a frame are acquired in parallel. The disadvantage of this is that the absence of confocal optics means that out of focus light can make it to the detection device (camera).

(ref:widefield-caption) Light travels from the uniformly illuminated sample through a lens (or a few lenses) to the camera. Not the simplicity of this setup relative to that of a confocal microscope.

```{r widefield, out.width='50%', fig.cap='(ref:widefield-caption)', echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("img", "Widefield.png"))
```


### Total internal reflection microscopy
_Total internal reflection microscopy_ (TIRF) uses the fact that when total internal reflection (TIR) is occurring, an evanescent wave is produced at the media boundary, but this evanescent wave is only present very close to the boundary. See figure \@ref(fig:TIRFig) [@TIRFig]. The huge advantage of TIRF is that only a single plane is illuminated, so when focusing on that plane, only in-focus light is collected (because only the in-focus plane is illuminated). The main disadvantage is that it is not applicable when one cannot get the object of interest right at the cover slip. Looking at figure \@ref(fig:TIRFig), it is evident that TIRF would be ideal for imaging the membrane but useless for imaging the nucleus.

(ref:TIRFig-caption) The thin evanescent wave close to the boundary (between the cover slip and sample) where TIR is occurring. Only the part of the sample within this thin evanescent wave is illuminated.

```{r TIRFig, fig.cap='(ref:TIRFig-caption)', echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("img", "TIRFig.png"))
```


### Cameras

There are many types of camera available for widefield microscopes, the most common being EMCCD, CMOS, and sCMOS cameras.


#### EMCCD cameras

A charge-coupled device (CCD) is a device for the movement of electric charge. An EMCCD camera is an array of CCDs (one per pixel). When photons strike a CCD in the camera, electrons are dissociated by the photoelectric effect. These free charges are then moved across the CCD and this current can be measured and used as a measure of light intensity (in arbitrary units) [@EMCCD]. The EM stands for _electron multiplied_ which tells us that EMCCD cameras use an amplification technique, just like PMTs and APDs (section \@ref(detectors)). 


#### CMOS cameras

Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor cameras are arrays of semiconductors (one per pixel), again utilizing the photoelectric effect and the electric field across a semiconductor. CMOS cameras have amplification for each pixel, whereas EMCCDs only have a few amplifiers per camera [@CMOS]. This makes CMOS cameras more sensitive.


#### sCMOS cameras 

Scientific CMOS (sCMOS) cameras consist of a CMOS circuit bonded to a CCD imaging substrate. These relatively new cameras offer 95% quantum efficiency [@photometrics], very low noise, rapid frame rates, large dynamic range, high resolution and wide field of view, all cheaper than a regular CCD [@sCMOS]. sCMOS cameras appear to better than anything that has come before.


#### Being quantitative with cameras

For electronic reasons, the noise from certain pixels on all of the cameras above may be correlated. This hinders some techniques in the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (section \@ref(FCS)). However, with careful characterization of the camera and correct mathematical treatment, quantitative studies can be carried out with cameras. Indeed, our group quantified the oligomeric state of the dynamin-2 protein at the HIV-1 fusion pore using data from a TIRF microscope with an EMCCD camera [@DanDynamin].


## Intensity traces

Consider figure \@ref(fig:confocal-volume-particle). A fluorophore enters the confocal volume, is excited there and emits photons which are collected by the detector. When the fluorophore is not in the confocal volume (start and end), no photons are detected. When the particle is in the confocal volume, photons it emits are collected at the detector. Different numbers of photons are collected per unit time (per ms here). 

(ref:confocal-volume-particle-caption) Left: a fluorophore diffusing through the confocal volume [@sphd]. Right: the intensity trace due to this fluorophore. 

```{r confocal-volume-particle, message=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', fig.cap='(ref:confocal-volume-particle-caption)', echo=FALSE}
set.seed(9)
cvp_png <- here("img", "cvp.png")
df_intensity_trace <- tibble(time = seq_len(100),
                             intensity = detrendr:::myrpois(c(rep(0, 30), 
                                                              rep(0.7, 40), 
                                                              rep(0, 30)))) 
p <- ggplot(df_intensity_trace) + aes(time, intensity) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + xlab("time (ms)")
ggsave(cvp_png, p, width = 2, height = 1.5)
include_graphics(c(here("img", "confocal_volume_particle.png"), cvp_png))
```

```{definition}
The time-series of intensity counts in a given pixel or image is referred to as its _intensity trace_.
```


## Diffusion

```{definition}
_Diffusion_ is the net movement of molecules or atoms from a region of high concentration (or high chemical potential) to a region of low concentration (or low chemical potential) as a result of random motion of the molecules or atoms.
```

Fick's first law of diffusion relates the concentration to the diffusive flux, assuming a steady state. It describes how the flux goes from high to low concentration areas, with magnitude proportional to the concentration gradient. The law is:

\begin{equation}
J = -D\frac{d\varphi}{dx}
(\#eq:ficksfirst)
\end{equation}

where

* $J$ is the diffusive flux
* $D$ is the diffusion constant
* $x$ is the position in space
* $\varphi$ is the concentration at position $x$.

```{definition}
_Brownian motion_ is the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid resulting from their collision with the fast-moving molecules in the fluid [@Brownian].
```

```{definition}
In an ensemble of $N$ particles, each of which occupies position $x_i(t)$ at time $t$, the _mean squared displacement_ of the particles in the ensemble is

\begin{equation}
\text{msd}(t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^N [x_i(t) - x_i(0)]^2
(\#eq:msd)
\end{equation}
```

For free Brownian motion in 1 dimension, the expected value of the MSD is $\text{msd}(t) = 2Dt$, where $D$ is the diffusion constant. For free Brownian motion in $d$ dimensions, the expected value of the MSD is $\text{msd}(t) = 2dDt$, reflecting the fact that free Brownian motion in $d$ dimensions is one-dimensional free Brownian motion happening simultaneously and independently in each individual dimension.

These definitions are the formally correct ones. In biophysics, however, both of these processes (diffusion and Brownian motion) are most often referred to as _diffusion_. Usually, in biophysics one is interested in proteins which move around in a medium like the cytoplasm or the cell membrane. When this is referred to as _diffusion_, it is what is defined as Brownian motion above. Henceforth when I use the term _diffusion_, this Brownian motion type of movement can be assumed.


### Anomalous diffusion

_Anomalous diffusion_ is a diffusion process whereby equation \@ref(eq:msd) no longer holds and the relationship between MSD and time becomes non-linear. Knowing whether diffusion is anomalous or free can offer biological insight. For example, regions of free and anomalous diffusion were measured with FCS (section \@ref(FCS)) to investigate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of lipid interaction in the plasma membrane of living cells [@EggSTEDFCS]. The pair correlation function approach (section \@ref(PCF)) can be used to image barriers to diffusion [@PCF]; diffusion barriers necessarily lead to anomalous diffusion.


## Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy {#FFS}

Broadly, fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) is the analysis of the intensity fluctuation of a fluorescence signal [@FFS]. This very often takes the form of moment analysis [@QianElson]. Briefly, moment analysis is an attempt to extract data from a distribution of values using its _moments_. The first moment of a distribution is its mean value, the second moment is its variance. The $n$^th^ moment of a random $X$ with expected value $E[X]=\mu$ for $n>1$ is $E[(X - \mu)^n]$.

Intensity traces can be viewed as distributions with moments. For example, the intensity trace in figure \@ref(fig:confocal-volume-particle) has mean `r round(mean(df_intensity_trace$intensity), 2)` and variance  `r round(var(df_intensity_trace$intensity), 2)`. 


### Number and brightness {#number-and-brightness}

_Number and brightness_ (N&B, @NB) is an FFS technique for quantifying the oligomeric states of fluorescently labelled proteins. What follows is a mathematical description of the technique.

```{definition}
An _entity_ is a set of molecules which are chemically bound.
```

```{definition}
The brightness $\epsilon$ of an entity is the mean number of photon detector counts it gives per unit time when in the illumination (confocal) volume.
```
For an image series where the $i$^th^ slice in the stack is the image acquired at time $t = i$, for a given pixel position $(x, y)$, we define $\langle I \rangle$ as the mean intensity of that pixel over the image series and $\sigma^2$ as the variance in that intensity. Define $n$ as the mean number of entities in the illumination volume corresponding to that pixel. Assuming that all entities are mobile, we have
\begin{align}
N &= \frac{\langle I \rangle^2}{\sigma^2} = \frac{\epsilon n}{1 + \epsilon} (\#eq:NB1-1) \\
B &= \frac{\sigma^2}{\langle I \rangle} = 1 + \epsilon (\#eq:NB1-2)
\end{align}
where $N$ and $B$ are referred to as the _apparent number_ and _apparent brightness_ respectively. This gives
\begin{align}
\epsilon &= \frac{\sigma^2}{\langle I \rangle} - 1 (\#eq:NB2-1) \\
n &= \frac{\langle I \rangle^2}{\sigma^2 - \langle I \rangle} (\#eq:NB2-2)
\end{align}
> 
> --- @NBreview^[This is a formulation of N&B that I wrote in a 2017 review of the technique.]

The quantity $\epsilon$ is a relative measure of oligomeric state. That is, $\epsilon$ will be twice as big for dimers as it is for monomers, three times as big for trimers as it is for monomers and so on.

The way that N&B experiments to determine unknown oligomeric states are generally done is as follows:

1. For a given laser power and fluorophore with a system where all entities are known to be monomeric, measure the brightness $\epsilon$. Call this $\epsilon_\text{monomer}$.
1. With the same laser power and fluorophore but now with a system where the oligomeric state is unknown, measure the brightness $\epsilon$ again. Call this $\epsilon_\text{unknown}$.
1. The unknown oligomeric state is equal to $\epsilon_\text{unknown} / \epsilon_\text{monomer}$. 

Number and brightness has specific pixel dwell-time and frame rate requirements. These were first articulated in my 2017 review of N&B [@NBreview]. 

```{definition}
The _pixel dwell time_ $t_\text{dwell}$ of a scanning confocal microscope is the amount of time it spends collecting photons at each given pixel before moving on to the next pixel.
```

It is essential that the pixel dwell time is the same for each pixel, particularly for FFS. This is something that must be carefully verified on each instrument. This can be done with a chroma-slide. The photon counts measured from a chroma-slide should follow a Poisson distribution. If instead the distribution is super-Poissonian (has a greater variance than its mean), this is indicative of a non-constant dwell-time.

```{definition}
The _frame time_ of a scanning confocal microscope is the amount of time it takes to acquire the data for all of the pixels in a whole frame. That is the length of time from the start of detectionion of photons from the first pixel to the end of detection of photons from the last pixel.
```

```{definition}
The mean _residence time_ $\tau_D$ of a particle in the confocal volume is the average length of time that a particle that enters the confocal volume resides in that volume before exiting.
```

The requirement is $t_\text{dwell} \ll \tau_D \ll t_\text{frame}$. This ensures that: 

1. When acquiring photons at a given pixel, the underlying configuration of entities is constant (there's not enough time for the entities to move and change their configuration). 
1. When the scanner returns to a given pixel (one frame time later), the underlying configuration has changed totally since the last time the scanner was at this pixel (because so much time has passed, all of the diffusing entities have moved a lot in the meantime).

Both of these points are implicitly assumed in the derivation of the N&B equations so it is essential to get these acquisition parameters right. This is discussed at length in @NBreview.

An important property of N&B is that if all fluorescent particles are immobile, then $B = 1$. This is because photon emission from stationary sources happens according to a Poisson distribution. Poisson distributions have variance equal to mean, this implies $\sigma^2$ = $\langle I \rangle$ which gives $B = \frac{\sigma^2}{\langle I \rangle} = 1$.

The N&B technique is fraught with technical difficulties. Principal of these is the problem of photobleaching. Most of my PhD focused on corrections for photobleaching. This is discussed in chapter \@ref(photobleaching-correction). 


## Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy {#FCS}

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is the correlation analysis of fluorescence intensity fluctuations. For this reason, FCS can be described as a subfield of FFS [@FFSnewage]. In practice, FFS is mostly used to refer to the non-FCS parts of the whole FFS field. I will follow that convention.

First, let us introduce some concepts from statistics.

```{definition, name='statistics'}
The _correlation_ between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ with expected values $\mu_X$ and $\mu_Y$ and standard deviations $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$ is
\begin{equation}
\text{corr}(X, Y) = \frac{E[(X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)]}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
(\#eq:correlation)
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the expectation operator.
```

```{definition, name='statistics'}
_Autocorrelation_ $G(X; \tau)$, is the correlation of a signal $X$ with a delayed copy of itself as a function of the delay $\tau$.
\begin{equation}
G(X; \tau) = \text{corr}(X_t, X_{t + \tau}) = \frac{E[(X_t - \mu_X)(X_{t + \tau} - \mu_X)]}{\sigma^2_X}
(\#eq:autocorrelation)
\end{equation}
```

```{definition, name='statistics'}
The _cross-correlation_ of two series is the correlation of one with a delayed copy of the other as a function of the delay.
\begin{equation}
\text{crosscorr}(X, Y; \tau) = \text{corr}(X_t, Y_{t + \tau}) = \frac{E[(X_t - \mu_X)(Y_{t + \tau} - \mu_Y)]}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
(\#eq:crosscorrelation)
\end{equation}
```

For the purposes of FCS, these quantities were redefined as follows. 

```{definition, name='FCS'}
The _correlation_ between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ with expected values $\mu_X$ and $\mu_Y$ and standard deviations $\sigma_X$ and $\sigma_Y$ is
\begin{equation}
\text{corr}(X, Y) = \frac{E[(X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)]}{\mu_X \mu_Y}
(\#eq:FCScorrelation)
\end{equation}
where $E$ is the expectation operator.
```

```{definition, name='FCS'}
_Autocorrelation_ $G(X; \tau)$, is the correlation of a signal $X$ with a delayed copy of itself as a function of the delay $\tau$.
\begin{equation}
G(X; \tau) = \text{corr}(X_t, X_{t + \tau}) = \frac{E[(X_t - \mu_X)(X_{t + \tau} - \mu_X)]}{\mu^2_X}
(\#eq:FCSautocorrelation)
\end{equation}
```

```{definition, name='FCS'}
The _cross-correlation_ of two series is the correlation of one with a delayed copy of the other as a function of the delay.
\begin{equation}
\text{crosscorr}(X, Y; \tau) = \text{corr}(X_t, Y_{t + \tau}) = \frac{E[(X_t - \mu_X)(Y_{t + \tau} - \mu_Y)]}{\mu_X \mu_Y}
(\#eq:FCScrosscorrelation)
\end{equation}
```

The reason for these redefinitions (which just involve replacing standard deviations with means in the denominators of each expression) is that with the FCS definition, the autocorrelation has the nice property that for normal diffusion

\begin{equation}
G(X; 0) = \frac{1}{n}
(\#eq:FCSautocorrprop)
\end{equation}

where $n$ is the mean number of fluorescent particles in the focal volume. The convenience of the statistics definitions is that there, correlations are guaranteed to be in $[-1, 1]$, with $0$ representing no correlation, $1$ perfect positive correlation and $-1$ perfect negative correlation; this is lost with the FCS definitions: 0 still represents no correlation, but correlation values are no longer bounded, so the ideas of perfect correlation are lost.

I felt it necessary to provide these definitions for two reasons:

1. It is important for people from the fields of FCS and pure mathematics/statistics to know that they have different definitions for the same thing.
1. In FCS, it's very common for people to mistake correlation for cross-correlation. This is unfortunate, but knowing about this common mistake is essential for navigating the field in a sensible manner. It seems that when people in the FCS field correlate the signals from two separate channels, they use the term _cross_-correlation, even though they're only using correlation. I think the idea of working _across_ two or more channels (and ideas such as _cross_-talk) leads to this confusion.

```{remark}
Henceforth, the FCS defintions of these quantities will be assumed.
```


### Correlation {#correlation}

Suppose that two proteins of interest A and B are labelled with red and green fluorophores respectively (and there is no bleed-through between these red and green channels). 

If these proteins are interacting, then

* interaction implies that A and B _co-diffuse_
* this implies that A and B co-diffuse
* this implies that for a given volume in the sample
  - more of A implies more of B
  - less of A implies less of B
  - more of B implies more of A
  - less of B implies less of A
  
Since the number of photons emitted is proportional to the amount of fluorophores present, it follows that

* more red photons implies more green photons
* less red photons implies less green photons
* more green photons implies more red photons
* less green photons implies less red photons

Altogether, this implies that the intensity traces from the red and green channels will be correlated. If these proteins are not interacting, then the intensity traces from the red and green channels will not be correlated. Thus, interaction of red A and green B necessarily leads to correlation in fluorescent signals from the red and green channels.^[This correlation may not always be detectable due to weak interaction or weak signal.]


### Autocorrelation

As mentioned already, the autocorrelation function (ACF) can be used to count the number of particles in the confocal volume. It can also be used to measure diffusion coefficients for various types of diffusion (normal, anomalous, polydisperse, etc.). The ACF is not used in my PhD.


### Cross-correlation

The cross-correlation of intensity traces from nearby pixels can be used to measure the velocity of the movement of the labelled particles between these two pixels [@STICS]. 


#### Pair correlation function {#PCF}

The phrase _pair correlation function_^[This was needless, it could just be called _cross-correlation function_ (PCF) but for the confusion about the term _cross-correlation_ in the FCS field.] was coined for this idea of cross-correlating intensity traces from nearby pixels. The PCF was used to image barriers to diffusion [@PCF] using the idea that the spatiotemporal correlation caused by particles moving from one place to another will not be present for positions $p_1$ and $p_2$ if they are on opposite sides of a barrier, because the barrier prevents travel from $p_1$ to $p_2$. It has also been used to create _diffusion tensors_: maps of diffusion velocities at every pixel [@DiffusionTensor]; this approach is similar to that of @STICS. 


### Cross-correlated brightness

_Cross-correlated brightness_ [@ccNB] molds the correlation idea (section \@ref(correlation)) into the framework of N&B. Suppose there are two channels with intensities $I_1$ and $I_2$. 

```{definition, name='cross-variance'}

\begin{equation}
\sigma^2_\text{cc} = E[(I_2 - \langle I_1 \rangle)(I_2 - \langle I_2 \rangle)]
(\#eq:cross-var)
\end{equation}

```

```{definition, name='cross-correlated brightness'}

\begin{equation}
B_\text{cc} = \frac{\sigma^2_\text{cc}}{\sqrt{\langle I_1 \rangle \langle I_2 \rangle}}
(\#eq:cross-corr-nb)
\end{equation}

```

$B_\text{cc}$ is related to $\text{corr}(I_1, I_2)$ by
\begin{equation}
B_\text{cc} = \sqrt{\langle I_1 \rangle \langle I_2 \rangle} \times \text{corr}(I_1, I_2)
(\#eq:bcc-corr)
\end{equation}
This means that $B_\text{cc}$ is just a scaled version of correlation. The need for this redefinition is unclear (but it is no harm). It does make the formula look like the brightness formula \@ref(eq:NB1-2), but no such oligomeric state information can be gleaned from $B_\text{cc}$. It is merely useful as a relative measure of interaction: higher $B_\text{cc}$ means more interaction, lower $B_\text{cc}$ means less interaction. It is commonly used to identify interactions. Then, conventional N&B performed on each of the channels (1 and 2) can be used to measure the stoichiometry of the interaction.

```{remark}
Since cross-correlated brightness uses correlation but not cross-correlation, it is a prime example of the confusing naming that pervades FCS. It should be called _correlated brightness_. Rather than rename it, I will continue to refer to it as cross-correlated brightness.
```


## Applications of FCS and FFS

FCS and FFS have been used in thousands of research projects. Here I number but a few for the sake of interest and to give biological context to these techniques.

Number and brightness (the prominent imaging FFS technique) has been used to:

* characterize the state of DNA aggregation in live cells [@Mieruszynski]
* measure the stoichiometry of scaffold complexes in live neurons [@Moutin]
* quantify interactions in gene expression networks [@Declerck]
* measure the oligomeric state of the dynamin-2 protein at the HIV-1 fusion pore [@DanDynamin]
* measure the stoichiometry of the interaction of HIV-1 with its receptor and co-receptor over time in the pre-fusion process [@HIVstoichiometry]

FCS has been used to:

* reveal structural and functional properties of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies [@Hoischen]
* demonstrate that HIV-1 evades antibody-dependent phagocytosis [@Gach]
* determine the size of nanodomains [@Fenz]
* perform chromatographic measurements [@Kisley]
* quantify interactions of membrane proteins [@Ly]
