If you are reading this on the web now but would like a pdf version, click on the download symbol at the top left of the page (to the right of the A) and select PDF. Apportion of credit Whilst I have attempted to make it clear throughout what I myself did and did not do in relation to all work mentioned, for clarity I include the following rules of thumb: The idea for fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) as the main area of my thesis was Sergi Padilla-Parra’s. Molecular biology was done by Maro Iliopoulou and Luis Alvarez. Imaging was done by Maro Iliopoulou, Luis Alvarez and Sergi Padilla-Parra. The idea that correction for bleaching was the crucial step for FFS analysis was formulated by Luis Alvarez, Sergi Padilla-Parra and I. I formulated the solutions for how to correctly correct for bleaching, i.e. the automatic parameter choice and the Robin Hood algorithm. I wrote all of the software and maintain all of it. All FFS analysis was performed using my software. The software was used to analyse data by Maro Iliopoulou, Luis Alvarez, Sergi Padilla Parra and I. On all papers where I am the first listed author, I wrote the paper, taking suggested amendments from other listed authors. The NSMB paper (Iliopoulou et al. 2018) was written by Maro and Sergi; I also made significant contributions to the writing of that manuscript but my main role in that project was in data analysis. In all other papers where I am listed as an author, my role was minor. Sergi Padilla-Parra is my supervisor. Luis Alvarez is a postdoctoral researcher in Sergi’s group and Maro Iliopoulou is a research assistant in Sergi’s group. Publications First author R. Nolan and S.
