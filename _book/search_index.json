These two electronic states (\\(S_0\\) and \\(S_1\\)) of a molecule are defined as the highest occupied molecular orbital (\\(S_0\\), HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (\\(S_1\\), LUMO). Each electronic state has various associated vibrational states between which non-radiative transitions can occur. An electron can be excited from the ground state \\(S_0\\) into the higher energy excited state \\(S_1\\) by absorption of a photon of the appropriate energy. The electron will remain in the excited state (possibly undergoing non-radiative transitions through vibrational states) for a period of nanoseconds before relaxing to the lower energy ground state, losing energy by means of emitting a photon of that energy. This is shown by means of a Jablonski diagram (figure 1.1). Figure 1.1: Jablonski diagram of the process of fluorescence. Absorption causes excitation, relaxation causes the emission of light. Definition 1.2 The fluorescence lifetime of an electron is the amount of time it remains in the excited state before returning to the ground state. Definition 1.3 A fluorophore is a fluorescent chemical compound that can re-emit light upon light excitation. Fluorophores under constant excitation emit light one photon at a time according to Poisson statistics. 1.1.1 Phosphorescence Definition 1.4 Excited electrons can undergo a forbidden transition into the triplet state \\(T_1\\), where they remain for a period of milliseconds before relaxing to the ground state with the emission of a photon. This is phosphorescence. 1.1.2 Photobleaching In reality, an incident photon can break the fluorophore such that it is subsequently unable to emit light. A fluorophore to which this has happened is said to be photobleached. 1.2 Confocal light microscopy All of the images used in my PhD were collected on a confocal microscope. This type of microscope guarantees that only in-focus light is collected at the detector. See figure 1.2. Figure 1.2: Confocal microscope light path showing how out of focus light does not make it to the detector.1 Definition 1.5 The confocal volume is the in-focus volume within a sample that is efficiently detected using a system designed with confocal optics (FCSXpert 2018). An image is acquired on a confocal microscope by scanning this apparatus across a sample, collecting one pixel at a time. 1.2.1 Detectors There are many types of confocal microscope detectors. I will discuss the most common ones here. Most rely on the photoelectric effect (Albert Einstein 1905), a phenomenon whereby incident light upon a material causes electrons to dissociate from that material. Definition 1.6 The quantum efficiency (QE) of a detector is the fraction of fluorescent signal that is reported by the detector. 1.2.1.1 Photon multiplier tubes Photon multiplier tubes (PMTs) use the photoelectric effect. Dissociated electrons are accelerated through a potential difference towards a cathode where their accumulated kinetic energy is used to release more electrons. These are then accelerated in vacuum towards another cathode and so on for a predefined number of these accelerations until at last the electrons are discharged into an anode where the current is measured (Hammamatsu 2007); see figure 1.3. This current corresponds to the incident light intensity. Figure 1.3: PMT detector setup. Electrons are dissociated by photons at the photocathode, accelerated towards various other cathodes where more and more are freed and then finally they arrive at the anode where the current is measured (Leica 2012). The QE of standard PMTs is approximately 25% for blue-green light. This is because many incident photons on the multi-alkali material of regular PMT photocathodes fail to free any electrons. This problem gets worse at higher wavelengths where photons have lower energy. PMTs also suffer significantly from thermal noise (whereby dissociated electrons are created due to heat energy). 1.2.1.2 Avalanche photo-diodes Definition 1.7 Avalanche multiplication in semiconductors occurs when free electrons which are moving in an electric field across the semiconductor collide with bound electrons, freeing them to move and indeed to free more bound electrons. This compounding increase in free electrons in the electric field leads to an increase in the electric current. Avalanche photo-diodes (APDs) are semiconductors that exploit the photoelectric effect together with avalanche multiplication (the photoelectric effect starts the avalanche) to convert light into measurable electric current; see figure 1.4. They are somewhat analogous to PMTs, using the avalanche effect in place of the series of cathodes. Figure 1.4: APD detector setup. The incident photon dissociates an electron. Given the electric field across the semiconductor, this electron is accelerated, initiating an avalanche (Leica 2012). The QE of APDs can be as high as 45%, however their dynamic range is low and they can only function with low-intensity light. APDs are less prone to thermal noise than PMTs. 1.2.1.3 Hybrid detectors APDs have better sensitivity and lower noise, however PMTs have a larger dynamic range. In hybrid detectors (HyDs), PMT and APD technology is combined to get the best of both worlds. With HyDs, photons are converted to electrons at the photocathode, then accelerated in vacuum towards a semiconductor where they initiate an electron avalanche. See figure 1.5. The difference between HyDs and APDs is this acceleration step. Figure 1.5: HyD detector setup. A photon dissociates an electron from the photocathode, this electron is then accelerated PMT-style towards an APD-style semiconductor setup, triggering an avalanche (Leica 2012). HyDs with GaAsP (gallium arsenide phosphide) photocathodes achieve a quantum efficiency of up to 50% (Leica 2012). They also suffer least from detector afterpulsing, a phenomenon which can cause real signal pulses to be followed by a feedback pulse at a later time (Zhao et al. 2003). With hybrid detectors, the electric current pulse caused by a photon striking the photocathode is strong (well above background) and sharp (the pulse is very short-lived). This means that it is easy to detect the arrival of single photons at the photocathode. This enables HyDs to have a photon-counting mode whereby the readout is in units of photons (not electron current). This is a much more physically relevant readout — given that we are interested in measuring fluorescence — which is very convenient for many biological applications, not least fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS, discussed in section 1.5). For this reason, the HyD was the detector of choice for all of the acquisitions in my thesis. Remark. Henceforth, intensity counts will be assumed to be in units of photons. 1.3 Intensity traces Consider figure 1.6. A fluorophore enters the confocal volume, is excited there and emits photons which are collected by the detector. When the fluorophore is not in the confocal volume (start and end), no photons are detected. When the particle is in the confocal volume, photons it emits are collected at the detector. Different numbers of photons are collected per unit time (per ms here). Figure 1.6: Left: a fluorophore diffusing through the confocal volume (Padilla-Parra 2009). Right: the intensity trace due to this fluorophore. This intensity trace has mean 0.27 and variance 0.48. Definition 1.8 The time-series of intensity counts in a given pixel or image is referred to as its intensity trace. 1.4 Diffusion Definition 1.9 Diffusion is the net movement of molecules or atoms from a region of high concentration (or high chemical potential) to a region of low concentration (or low chemical potential) as a result of random motion of the molecules or atoms. Fick’s first law of diffusion relates the concentration to the diffusive flux, assuming a steady state. It describes how the flux goes from high to low concentration areas, with magnitude proportional to the concentration gradient. The law is: \\[\\begin{equation} J = -D\\frac{d\\varphi}{dx} \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(J\\) is the diffusive flux \\(D\\) is the diffusion constant \\(x\\) is the position in space \\(\\varphi\\) is the concentration at position \\(x\\). Definition 1.10 Brownian motion is the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid resulting from their collision with the fast-moving molecules in the fluid (A. Einstein 1905). Definition 1.11 In an ensemble of \\(N\\) particles, each of which occupies position \\(x_i(t)\\) at time \\(t\\), the mean squared displacement of the particles in the ensemble is \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{msd}(t) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i = 1}^N [x_i(t) - x_i(0)]^2 \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] For free Brownian motion in 1 dimension, the expected value of the MSD is \\(\\text{msd}(t) = 2Dt\\), where \\(D\\) is the diffusion constant. For free Brownian motion in \\(d\\) dimensions, the expected value of the MSD is \\(\\text{msd}(t) = 2dDt\\), reflecting the fact that free Brownian motion in \\(d\\) dimensions is one-dimensional free Brownian motion happening simultaneously and independently in each individual dimension. These definitions are the formally correct ones. In biophysics, however, both of these processes (diffusion and Brownian motion) are most often referred to as diffusion. I will follow this convention. 1.4.1 Anomalous diffusion Anomalous diffusion is a diffusion process whereby equation (1.2) no longer holds and the relationship between MSD and time becomes \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{msd}(t) = 2dDt^\\alpha \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\alpha \\neq 1\\). \\(\\alpha &gt; 1\\) is known as superdiffusion (faster than normal) and \\(\\alpha &lt; 1\\) is known as subdiffusion (slower than normal). 1.4.2 Diffusion in the presence of barriers If barriers to diffusion are present, neither equations (1.2) and (1.3) hold. The pair correlation function approach (section 1.6.3.1) can be used to image barriers to diffusion (M. A. Digman and Gratton 2009). 1.5 Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy Broadly, fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) is the analysis of the intensity fluctuation of a fluorescence signal (Chen et al. 1999). This very often takes the form of moment analysis (Qian and Elson 1990). Briefly, moment analysis is an attempt to extract data from a distribution of values using its moments. The first moment of a distribution is its mean value, the second moment is its variance. The \\(n\\)th moment of a random variable \\(X\\) with expected value \\(E[X]=\\mu\\) for \\(n&gt;1\\) is \\(E[(X - \\mu)^n]\\). Intensity traces can be viewed as distributions with moments. For example, the intensity trace in figure 1.6 has mean 0.27 and variance 0.48. 1.5.1 Number and brightness Number and brightness (N&amp;B, Digman et al. (2008)) is an FFS technique for quantifying the oligomeric states of fluorescently labelled proteins. What follows is a mathematical description of the technique. Definition 1.12 An entity is a set of molecules which are chemically bound. Definition 1.13 The brightness \\(\\epsilon\\) of an entity is the mean number of photon detector counts it gives per unit time when in the illumination (confocal) volume. For an image series where the \\(i\\)th slice in the stack is the image acquired at time \\(t = i\\), for a given pixel position \\((x, y)\\), we define \\(\\langle I \\rangle\\) as the mean intensity of that pixel over the image series and \\(\\sigma^2\\) as the variance in that intensity. Define \\(n\\) as the mean number of entities in the illumination volume corresponding to that pixel. Assuming that all entities are mobile, we have \\[\\begin{align} N &amp;= \\frac{\\langle I \\rangle^2}{\\sigma^2} = \\frac{\\epsilon n}{1 + \\epsilon} \\tag{1.4} \\\\ B &amp;= \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\langle I \\rangle} = 1 + \\epsilon \\tag{1.5} \\end{align}\\] where \\(N\\) and \\(B\\) are referred to as the apparent number and apparent brightness respectively. This gives \\[\\begin{align} n &amp;= \\frac{\\langle I \\rangle^2}{\\sigma^2 - \\langle I \\rangle} \\tag{1.6} \\\\ \\epsilon &amp;= \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\langle I \\rangle} - 1 \\tag{1.7} \\end{align}\\] These relations are derived using a moment analysis technique which was originally applied to molecules in solution (Qian and Elson 1990). With a scanning confocal microscope in analog mode, we must use three correction terms: 1. The proportionality constant \\(S\\), which is the conversion factor between photons detected and the number of counts returned by the analog electronics. 2. The offset (bias) due to the analog electronics in the level of the background. 3. The readout noise \\(\\sigma_0^2\\) is the variance in this background signal (Dalal et al. 2008). Then, if all entities are mobile, we have \\[\\begin{align} N &amp;= \\frac{(\\langle I \\rangle - \\text{ offset})^2}{\\sigma^2 - \\sigma_0^2} = \\frac{\\epsilon n}{1 + \\epsilon} \\tag{1.8} \\\\ B &amp;= \\frac{\\sigma^2 - \\sigma_0^2}{\\langle I \\rangle - \\text{ offset}} = S(1 + \\epsilon) \\tag{1.9} \\end{align}\\] \\[\\begin{align} n &amp;= \\frac{(\\langle I \\rangle - \\text{ offset})^2}{\\sigma^2 - \\sigma_0^2 - S(\\langle I \\rangle - \\text{ offset})} \\tag{1.10} \\\\ \\epsilon &amp;= \\frac{\\sigma^2 - \\sigma_0^2}{S(\\langle I \\rangle - \\text{ offset})} - 1 \\tag{1.11} \\end{align}\\] — Nolan, Iliopoulou, et al. (2017)2 The quantity \\(\\epsilon\\) is a relative measure of oligomeric state. That is, \\(\\epsilon\\) will be twice as big for dimers as it is for monomers, three times as big for trimers as it is for monomers and so on. The way that N&amp;B experiments to determine unknown oligomeric states are generally done is as follows: For a given laser power and fluorophore with a system where all entities are known to be monomeric, measure the brightness \\(\\epsilon\\). Call this \\(\\epsilon_\\text{monomer}\\). With the same laser power and fluorophore but now with a system where the oligomeric state is unknown, measure the brightness \\(\\epsilon\\) again. Call this \\(\\epsilon_\\text{unknown}\\). The unknown oligomeric state is equal to \\(\\epsilon_\\text{unknown} / \\epsilon_\\text{monomer}\\). Number and brightness has specific pixel dwell-time and frame rate requirements. These were first articulated in my 2017 review of N&amp;B (Nolan, Iliopoulou, et al. 2017). Definition 1.14 The pixel dwell time \\(t_\\text{dwell}\\) of a scanning confocal microscope is the amount of time it spends collecting photons at each given pixel before moving on to the next pixel. It is essential that the pixel dwell time is the same for each pixel, particularly for FFS. This is something that must be carefully verified on each instrument. This can be done with a chroma-slide. The photon counts measured from a chroma-slide should follow a Poisson distribution. If instead the distribution is super-Poissonian (has a greater variance than its mean), this is indicative of a non-constant dwell-time. Definition 1.15 The frame time \\(t_\\text{frame}\\) of a scanning confocal microscope is the amount of time it takes to acquire the data for all of the pixels in a whole frame. That is the length of time from the start of detection of photons from the first pixel to the end of detection of photons from the last pixel. Definition 1.16 The mean residence time \\(\\tau_D\\) of a particle in the confocal volume is the average length of time that a particle that enters the confocal volume resides in that volume before exiting. The requirement is \\(t_\\text{dwell} \\ll \\tau_D \\ll t_\\text{frame}\\). This ensures that: When acquiring photons at a given pixel, the underlying configuration of entities is constant (there’s not enough time for the entities to move and change their configuration). When the scanner returns to a given pixel (one frame time later), the underlying configuration has changed totally since the last time the scanner was at this pixel (because so much time has passed, all of the diffusing entities have moved a lot in the meantime). Both of these points are implicitly assumed in the derivation of the N&amp;B equations so it is essential to get these acquisition parameters right. This is discussed at length in Nolan, Iliopoulou, et al. (2017). An important property of N&amp;B is that if all fluorescent particles are immobile, then \\(B = 1\\). This is because photon emission from stationary sources happens according to a Poisson distribution. Poisson distributions have variance equal to mean, this implies \\(\\sigma^2\\) = \\(\\langle I \\rangle\\) which gives \\(B = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\langle I \\rangle} = 1\\). The N&amp;B technique is fraught with technical difficulties. Principal of these is the problem of photobleaching. Most of my PhD focused on corrections for photobleaching. This is discussed in chapter 3. 1.6 Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is the correlation analysis of fluorescence intensity fluctuations. For this reason, FCS can be described as a subfield of FFS (Jameson, Ross, and Albanesi 2009). In practice, FFS is mostly used to refer to the non-FCS parts of the whole FFS field. I will follow that convention. First, let us introduce some concepts from statistics. Definition 1.17 (statistics) The correlation between two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) with expected values \\(\\mu_X\\) and \\(\\mu_Y\\) and standard deviations \\(\\sigma_X\\) and \\(\\sigma_Y\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{corr}(X, Y) = \\frac{E[(X - \\mu_X)(Y - \\mu_Y)]}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y} \\tag{1.12} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(E\\) is the expectation operator. Definition 1.18 (statistics) Autocorrelation \\(G(X; \\tau)\\), is the correlation of a signal \\(X\\) with a delayed copy of itself as a function of the delay \\(\\tau\\). \\[\\begin{equation} G(X; \\tau) = \\text{corr}(X_t, X_{t + \\tau}) = \\frac{E[(X_t - \\mu_X)(X_{t + \\tau} - \\mu_X)]}{\\sigma^2_X} \\tag{1.13} \\end{equation}\\] Definition 1.19 (statistics) The cross-correlation of two series is the correlation of one with a delayed copy of the other as a function of the delay. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{crosscorr}(X, Y; \\tau) = \\text{corr}(X_t, Y_{t + \\tau}) = \\frac{E[(X_t - \\mu_X)(Y_{t + \\tau} - \\mu_Y)]}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y} \\tag{1.14} \\end{equation}\\] For the purposes of FCS, these quantities were redefined as follows. Definition 1.20 (FCS) The correlation between two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) with expected values \\(\\mu_X\\) and \\(\\mu_Y\\) and standard deviations \\(\\sigma_X\\) and \\(\\sigma_Y\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{corr}(X, Y) = \\frac{E[(X - \\mu_X)(Y - \\mu_Y)]}{\\mu_X \\mu_Y} \\tag{1.15} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(E\\) is the expectation operator. Definition 1.21 (FCS) Autocorrelation \\(G(X; \\tau)\\), is the correlation of a signal \\(X\\) with a delayed copy of itself as a function of the delay \\(\\tau\\). \\[\\begin{equation} G(X; \\tau) = \\text{corr}(X_t, X_{t + \\tau}) = \\frac{E[(X_t - \\mu_X)(X_{t + \\tau} - \\mu_X)]}{\\mu^2_X} \\tag{1.16} \\end{equation}\\] Definition 1.22 (FCS) The cross-correlation of two series is the correlation of one with a delayed copy of the other as a function of the delay. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{crosscorr}(X, Y; \\tau) = \\text{corr}(X_t, Y_{t + \\tau}) = \\frac{E[(X_t - \\mu_X)(Y_{t + \\tau} - \\mu_Y)]}{\\mu_X \\mu_Y} \\tag{1.17} \\end{equation}\\] The reason for these redefinitions (which just involve replacing standard deviations with means in the denominators of each expression) is that with the FCS definition, the autocorrelation has the nice property that for normal diffusion \\[\\begin{equation} G(X; 0) = \\frac{1}{n} \\tag{1.18} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n\\) is the mean number of fluorescent particles in the focal volume. The convenience of the statistics definitions is that there, correlations are guaranteed to be in \\([-1, 1]\\), with \\(0\\) representing no correlation, \\(1\\) perfect positive correlation and \\(-1\\) perfect negative correlation; this is lost with the FCS definitions: 0 still represents no correlation, but correlation values are no longer bounded, so the ideas of perfect correlation are lost. I felt it necessary to provide these definitions for two reasons: It is important for people from the fields of FCS and pure mathematics/statistics to know that they have different definitions for the same thing. In FCS, it’s very common for people to mistake correlation for cross-correlation. This is unfortunate, but knowing about this common mistake is essential for navigating the field in a sensible manner. It seems that when people in the FCS field correlate the signals from two separate channels, they use the term cross-correlation, even though they’re only using correlation. I think the idea of working across two or more channels (and ideas such as cross-talk) leads to this confusion. Remark. Henceforth, the FCS defintions of these quantities will be assumed. 1.6.1 Correlation Co-diffusing fluorophores of different colours will necessarily induce positive correlation between the intensity traces of these two colour channels because co-diffusion means that presence of one fluorophore necessarily implies presence of the other fluorophore. Hence, correlation may be used as a measure of co-diffusion, and co-diffusion is often interpreted as interaction (the simplest explanation for co-diffusion is that the co-diffusing entities are somehow stuck together). This idea forms the basis of much of FCS. This does not hold for immobile particles. Immobile particles are not diffusing, so it doesn’t make sense to employ a measure of diffusion. Bleed-through of photons from one channel to another will induce artefactual correlation between the intensities of the two channels. Alternating laser excitation (ALEX, Kapanidis et al. (2005)) can be used to eliminate bleed through; however when using ALEX it is important to bear in mind that the two channels are no longer being acquired simultaneously. This is of particular importance for FCS. However if the instrument can go fast enough (with a laser alternation time much less than the residence time of the diffusing entities), this problem is negligible. If the density of fluorophores under observation is too high, correlation can be practically impossible to measure. For example, the difference between 1 and 0 is much easier to detect than the difference between 11 and 10. At high density, relative differences are lower and hence harder to detect. 1.6.2 Autocorrelation As mentioned already, the autocorrelation function (ACF) can be used to count the number of particles in the confocal volume. It can also be used to measure diffusion coefficients. The ACF is not used in my PhD. 1.6.3 Cross-correlation The cross-correlation of intensity traces from nearby pixels can be used to measure the velocity of the movement of the labelled particles between these two pixels (Hebert, Costantino, and Wiseman 2005). 1.6.3.1 Pair correlation function The phrase pair correlation function3 was coined for this idea of cross-correlating intensity traces from nearby pixels. The PCF was used to image barriers to diffusion (M. A. Digman and Gratton 2009) using the idea that the spatiotemporal correlation caused by particles moving from one place to another will not be present for positions \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) if they are on opposite sides of a barrier, because the barrier prevents travel from \\(p_1\\) to \\(p_2\\). It has also been used to calculate the velocities of diffusing entities at each pixel in an image. The collection of these velocities at each pixel is known as a diffusion tensor (Rienzo et al. 2016). This approach is similar to that of Hebert, Costantino, and Wiseman (2005). 1.6.4 Cross-correlated brightness Cross-correlated brightness (M. A. Digman et al. 2009) molds the correlation idea (section 1.6.1) into the framework of N&amp;B. Cross-correlated brightness isn’t really a brightness at all, it’s just a measure of correlation. Suppose there are two channels with intensities \\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\). Definition 1.23 (cross-variance) \\[\\begin{equation} \\sigma^2_\\text{cc} = E[(I_2 - \\langle I_1 \\rangle)(I_2 - \\langle I_2 \\rangle)] \\tag{1.19} \\end{equation}\\] Definition 1.24 (cross-correlated brightness) \\[\\begin{equation} B_\\text{cc} = \\frac{\\sigma^2_\\text{cc}}{\\sqrt{\\langle I_1 \\rangle \\langle I_2 \\rangle}} \\tag{1.20} \\end{equation}\\] \\(B_\\text{cc}\\) is related to \\(\\text{corr}(I_1, I_2)\\) by \\[\\begin{equation} B_\\text{cc} = \\sqrt{\\langle I_1 \\rangle \\langle I_2 \\rangle} \\times \\text{corr}(I_1, I_2) \\tag{1.21} \\end{equation}\\] This means that \\(B_\\text{cc}\\) is just a scaled version of correlation. The need for this redefinition is unclear (but it is no harm). It does make the formula look like the brightness formula (1.5), but no such oligomeric state information can be gleaned from \\(B_\\text{cc}\\). It is merely useful as a relative measure of interaction: higher \\(B_\\text{cc}\\) means more interaction, lower \\(B_\\text{cc}\\) means less interaction. It is commonly used to identify interactions. Then, conventional N&amp;B performed on each of the channels (1 and 2) can be used to measure the stoichiometry of the interaction. Remark. Since cross-correlated brightness uses correlation but not cross-correlation, it is a prime example of the confusing naming that pervades FCS. It should be called correlated brightness. Rather than rename it, I will continue to refer to it as cross-correlated brightness. 1.7 Applications of FCS and FFS FCS and FFS have been used in thousands of research projects. Here I number but a few for the sake of interest and to give biological context to these techniques. Number and brightness (the prominent imaging FFS technique) has been used to: characterize the state of DNA aggregation in live cells (Mieruszynski et al. 2015) measure the stoichiometry of scaffold complexes in live neurons (Moutin et al. 2014) quantify interactions in gene expression networks (Declerck and Royer 2013) measure the oligomeric state of the dynamin-2 protein at the HIV-1 fusion pore (Jones et al. 2017) measure the stoichiometry of the interaction of HIV-1 with its receptor and co-receptor over time in the pre-fusion process (Iliopoulou et al. 2018) FCS has been used to: reveal structural and functional properties of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (Hoischen et al. 2018) demonstrate that HIV-1 evades antibody-dependent phagocytosis (Gach et al. 2017) determine the size of nanodomains (Fenz, Smith, and Monzel 2017) perform chromatographic measurements (Kisley and Landes 2014) quantify interactions of membrane proteins (Ly et al. 2014) References "],

In reality, it is possible that the incident photon can break the fluorophore with the result that it will no longer emit light. This breaking is referred to as photobleaching (or bleaching for short). Bleaching causes a diminution in the number of effective fluorophores, which is a direct cause of a loss of fluorescent signal. Many quantitative methods in fields such as fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) implicitly assume that there is no bleaching in the data. Hence, data (image series) with significant levels of photobleaching must be corrected prior to the application of equations and algorithms in these fields. A main focus of this thesis is on how to correct fluorescent image series for the effects of bleaching, given that bleaching does occur. There is no attempt to understand why and/or how photobleaching occurs. Remark. All of the current literature mentions bleaching correction as being purely for correcting the problem of non-stationary mean (NSM), neglecting the problem of non-stationary variance (NSV). Figure 3.5 shows that NSM and NSV go hand-in-hand. Correction for NSM is referred to as trend removal or detrending. Hence, the terms detrending and bleaching correction have come to be used interchangeably. I will follow this convention and use the term detrending from now on to mean correction for NSM and possibly also NSV. Starting at section 3.3, the focus is on correcting for NSM. Discussion of correction for NSV starts in section 3.7. 3.2 The effects of bleaching in FCS and FFS We simulate two image series with 500 frames, 64x64 pixels per frame (pixel size 1 \\(\\mu\\)m), each with 100,000 diffusing (\\(D = 100~\\mu\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}\\)) fluorescent particles which are uniformly distributed at the beginning. In the first image series (img1), these have brightness \\(\\epsilon = 4\\) and in the second (img2) they have brightness \\(\\epsilon = 7\\). See figure 3.1. We bleach these by 15% and 20% to create img1_bleached and img2_bleached respectively. Figure 3.1: Frames 1, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 from simulated image series. \\(\\epsilon = 4\\) (top) and \\(\\epsilon = 7\\) (bottom) with 15% (top) and 20% (bottom) bleaching. It may not be obvious that these image series are subject to bleaching from figure 3.1, but we can see it more clearly in figure 3.2. Figure 3.2: Mean intensity profiles of the simulated image series with and without bleaching. Simulation 1 was bleached by 15% and simulation 2 by 20%. The bleaching is such that the mean intensity decreases according to a single exponential decay (even though it looks quite linear). 3.2.1 FCS The unrelated images img1 and img2 have a tiny median cross-correlated brightness of \\(B_\\text{cc} = 0.0036\\), signifying no significant correlation, as one would expect. However, the bleached images img1_bleached and img2_bleached have a significant \\(B_\\text{cc} = 0.3686\\). This shows that bleaching is introducing correlation between otherwise unrelated images. Since correlation is used as a proxy for hetero-interaction, bleaching can make it appear as though there is interaction when in fact there is not. 3.2.1.1 Why does bleaching introduce correlation Let’s take another look at the formula for correlation: Definition 3.1 (FCS) The correlation between two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) with expected values \\(\\mu_X\\) and \\(\\mu_Y\\) and standard deviations \\(\\sigma_X\\) and \\(\\sigma_Y\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{corr}(X, Y) = \\frac{E[(X - \\mu_X)(Y - \\mu_Y)]}{\\mu_X \\mu_Y} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] So correlation is answering the question: Do \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) deviate from their mean at the same time and in the same or opposite direction? If there is no pattern in their deviations from mean, then the correlation will be zero. If they deviate from their means in the same direction at the same time, there’ll be a positive correlation; if they deviate from their means in the opposite direction at the same time, there’ll be a negative correlation. Correlation is all about measuring whether deviation from mean in two different series is synchronised or not. Let’s create two unrelated intensity traces \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), both of length 500. \\(X\\) will be Poisson(\\(\\lambda = 50\\)) and \\(Y\\) will be Poisson(\\(\\lambda = 30\\)). ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: X and Y ## t = 1.0731, df = 498, p-value = 0.2837 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -0.03982597 0.13515369 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.04803237 Figure 3.3: Unrelated intensity traces \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) with their means in red. There’s no pattern in how \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) deviate from their means, indeed a Pearson correlation test of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) returns an insignificant \\(p\\)-value of 0.28. Now let’s bleach them both by 90%. Figure 3.4: Unrelated intensity traces \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) with their means in red. Now, there is visible correlation. At the start of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), both are consistently above their mean and at the end, both are consistently below. They are simultaneously above and below respectively, so there will be positive correlation. This is backed up by a Pearson correlation test which returns a significant \\(p\\)-value of less than \\(10^{-200}\\). Remark. Bleaching also introduces autocorrelation for the same reason. The series \\(X\\) had no autocorrelation before bleaching (\\(p\\) = 0.23), whereas after bleaching, \\(X\\) has significant autocorrelation (\\(p &lt; 10^{-200}\\)). 3.2.2 FFS Definition 3.2 (median mean pixel intensity) The median mean pixel intensity of an image series is found by taking the mean intensity of each pixel in the image series and then taking the median of those means. It can be thought of as a summary statistic for the pixel intensity of the image series. Definition 3.3 (median pixel intensity variance) The median pixel intensity variance of an image series is found by taking the variance in the intensity of each pixel in the image series and then taking the median of those variances. It can be thought of as a summary statistic for the variance in the pixel intensity of the image series. In FFS, one is always interested in the mean and variance of pixel values. img1 has a median mean pixel intensity of 98 and a median pixel intensity variance of 487. The mean brightness is \\(\\epsilon = 3.9959\\) (very close to 4, as expected since the image series was simulated with brightness \\(\\epsilon = 4\\)). For img1_bleached, we find a median mean pixel intensity of 90 and a median pixel intensity variance of 468. The mean brightness is \\(\\epsilon = 4.2026\\). Hence, bleaching has altered both the means and variances of the pixels, resulting in a change in calculated brightness. The non-stationary mean frame intensity introduced by bleaching decreases the mean but increases the variance. The loss in signal has the effect of slightly decreasing the variance: with Poisson statistics (such as photon-emission), a loss of signal (photons) leads directly to a loss in variance. This is a subtle point not discussed anywhere in the literature; it is shown in figure 3.5. Figure 3.5: A decrease in the Poisson rate (e.g. for emission of photons) leads to a decrease in the mean (blue line) but also a decrease in fluctuations around the mean. Notice that towards the right where rate is low, fluctuations around the mean are at their smallest. 3.3 Exponential fitting detrending Naively, one could assume that bleaching of fluorophores takes place at some constant rate. This would mean that the intensity of the image would die-off according to an exponential decay. In figure 3.6, we fit an exponential decay to such ideal data. Figure 3.6: Exponential fit to intensity trace of image which is subject to bleaching at a constant rate. Having fit the data, one may record the deviations from the fitted line as the fluctuations and replace these fluctuations about a straight line, which is placed at the mean of the original series; for figure 3.6 above, this mean is 90. Figure 3.7 shows the corrected series. Figure 3.7: The blue line from figure 3.6 has changed to a straight horizontal line cutting the \\(y\\) axis at the mean intensity of the original intensity trace. The fluctuations about the blue line that existed in figure 3.6 are preserved here. As an example, see the large downward fluctuation at \\(t \\approx 50\\) seconds in both figures. We can see that here, in the ideal case where the naive assumptions of the exponential decay fitting approach hold, this approach works quite well. Let us now examine the case where these assumptions don’t hold because there are other long-term fluctuations e.g. due to cell movement. We add these other fluctuations as a gentle sinusoid. See figure 3.8. Figure 3.8: An exponential decay with added sinusoidal variance, fit with a simple exponential decay. One can see by eye that this is not a good fit for the data. This has disastrous consequences for the detrended series, shown in figure 3.9. Figure 3.9: Result of exponential fitting detrending applied to a decay with a long-term sinusoidal trend component. One can see in figure 3.9 that the exponential fit detrend failed to remove the sinusoidal trend in the data (even though it did remove the exponential decay component). We have now seen that exponential fitting detrending is appropriate when the decay has a particular form, but is otherwise not fit for use. This is a problem common to all fitting approaches to detrending, even the more flexible types like polynomial detrending (Chan, Hayya, and Ord 1977). For this reason alone, for the purpose of detrending, fitting approaches should be avoided. 3.4 Boxcar smoothing detrending A common approach to obtaining the line from which to measure deviations/fluctuations (as in the red line in figure 3.6) is to smooth the time series, i.e. construct the line by taking a local average at each point. This is often referred to as boxcar smoothing because it can be visualized as drawing a box around a neighborhood of points, taking their average as the smoothed value at that point and then moving the box onto the next series of points and repeating the procedure; see figure 3.10. Figure 3.10: The original time series is depicted by the red dots. The blue rectangles represent the boxcar. This boxcar is said to be of length 3 because it is wide enough to encompass 3 points at a time. The boxcar is centered on a point and then the smoothed value at that point (blue dot) is calculated as the mean value of all points within the boxcar. In reality, every point gets a smoothed value which means that the boxcar overlaps but in this figure—for the sake of clarity—they are not overlapped. The length of the boxcar is equal to \\(2l + 1\\) for natural numbered parameter \\(l \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). This ensures that the length of the boxcar is always odd) which means it can always be centered upon a point). Hence the allowable lengths of a boxcar are \\(3,5,7,9,\\) etc. The boxcar parameter \\(l\\) has a large effect on the type of smoothing achieved. This can be seen in figure 3.11 where boxcar smoothing is applied to the trace in figure 3.6. The traces for \\(l=1\\) and \\(l=3\\) are far too wiggly (not smooth enough); the trace for \\(l=75\\) is better but perhaps still slightly wiggly; finally, the traces for \\(l=300\\) and \\(l=1000\\) are too close to straight horizontal lines (too smooth). Figure 3.11: The original intensity trace is shown in the top-left. The other panels show the result of boxcar smoothing for \\(l = 1, 3, 75, 300\\) and \\(1000\\). \\(l=1\\) and \\(l=3\\) are not smooth enough, \\(l = 75\\) looks like it might be OK although it is slightly wiggly. \\(l = 300\\) and \\(l = 1000\\) are over-smoothed. This begs the question: what is the correct smoothing parameter \\(l\\)? 3.5 The correct smoothing parameter for detrending Figure 3.11 shows that the choice of boxcar size is crucial because different sizes lead to very different smoothed lines. The most common choice in the community is to choose \\(l = 10\\) (Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics 2018). There is no justification for this choice. In section 1.5.1, we learned that for immobile particles, the expected brightness is \\(B = 1\\). This fact can be used to solve for the appropriate choice of \\(l\\) to use for detrending a specific image series. Definition 3.4 The mean intensity profile of one channel of an image series is obtained by calculating the mean intensity of each frame in that image series. The mean intensity profile can be used to visualize the bleaching of an image series. If the fluorophores are bleaching, the mean intensity should be decreasing over time. To proceed with solving for the appropriate \\(l\\), we need to make one assumption; this is that any two image series with the same mean intensity profile are appropriately detrended with the same detrending parameter \\(l\\). This assumption seems reasonable, however there is no need to debate its validity because later, detrending with the solved-for parameter \\(l\\) will be evaluated with simulated data and compared to the standard \\(l = 10\\). If this assumption is bad, then the performance of the detrending that relies on it should also be bad. With this assumption in hand, solving for \\(l\\) proceeds as follows: Simulate an image series with immobile particles only which has the same mean intensity profile as the acquired real data. Given that the simulated series is of immobile particles only, once properly detrended, it should have \\(B = 1\\). The \\(l\\) for which the detrended series has mean brightness closest to 1 is the most appropriate for the simulated data. By the assumption above, this \\(l\\) is the most appropriate for the real data. Mathematically, this can be expressed as \\[\\begin{equation} l = \\text{argmin}_{\\tilde{l}} |1 - (\\text{mean brightness of simulated series detrended with parameter } \\tilde{l})| \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] In fact, what I have done here is to give a general method for solving for any detrending parameter \\(\\alpha\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\alpha = \\text{argmin}_{\\tilde{\\alpha}} |1 - (\\text{mean brightness of simulated series detrended with parameter } \\tilde{\\alpha})| \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] This will be useful later when other detrending regimes with their own parameters are introduced. 3.6 Exponential smoothing detrending Exponential smoothing is a slight alteration to boxcar smoothing. The idea is that when computing a local average, points nearer to the point of interest should have greater weights. The weights fall off with distance \\(|t|\\) from the point of interest according to \\(\\exp(-\\frac{|t|}{\\tau})\\) where the parameter \\(\\tau\\) is a positive real number. This function is visualized in figure 3.12. For small values of \\(\\tau\\), only values very close to the point of interest have importance when calculating the local average. For larger values of \\(\\tau\\), further values also have importance (but closer values always have higher weights). In this sense, increasing the value of \\(\\tau\\) has a similar effect to increasing the value of \\(l\\) for the boxcar in that further away points are taken into account. Figure 3.12: The function \\(\\exp(-\\frac{|t|}{\\tau})\\) visualized with \\(\\tau = 2\\) and \\(\\tau = 9\\). For \\(\\tau = 2\\), points at distance \\(|t| = 10\\) have approximately zero weight, whereas for \\(\\tau = 9\\), these points have significant weight. In figure 3.13, exponential smoothing with different parameters \\(\\tau\\) is applied to the trace in figure 3.6. The results are similar to those in figure 3.11. Figure 3.13: The original intensity trace is shown in the top-left. The other panels show the result of exponential smoothing for \\(\\tau = 1, 3, 75, 300\\) and \\(1000\\). Heuristically, exponential smoothing detrending seems favorable to boxcar detrending because the idea that points further away from the point of interest are less important (but still somewhat important) when computing the local average is reasonable. Indeed, this was the method proposed in the original number and brightness paper (Digman et al. 2008). For this reason, exponential smoothing was the method of choice for my paper where the method of choosing the correct detrending parameter was published (Nolan, Alvarez, et al. 2017). 3.7 Correcting for non-stationary variance Definition 3.5 The variance of a random variable \\(X\\) is the expected value of the squared deviation of \\(X\\) from its mean \\(\\mu\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Var}(X) = E[(X - \\mu)^2] \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] All of this chapter so far has focused on correcting for non-stationary mean. As shown in figure 3.5, as the mean decreases, so too does the variance. For an instance \\(x\\) of the random variable \\(X\\) with expected value \\(E[X] = \\mu\\), \\(x - \\mu\\) is the deviation of \\(x\\) from \\(\\mu\\). If we write \\(x\\) as \\(x = \\mu + \\tilde{x}\\), then we get the deviation \\(x - \\mu = (\\mu + \\tilde{x}) - \\mu = \\tilde{x}\\), so \\(\\tilde{x}\\) is the deviation. For a given point in figure 3.5, its deviation is its distance from the red line. For positive real number \\(k\\), making the transformation \\(\\tilde{x} \\rightarrow \\sqrt{k}\\tilde{x}\\) i.e. \\(x \\rightarrow \\mu + \\sqrt{k}\\tilde{x}\\) causes the variance (i.e. the squared deviation) to be transformed as \\(\\text{Var}(X) \\rightarrow k \\times \\text{Var}(X)\\). Hence, we have a way to modify the variance of a time series as a whole by modifying the deviation of each time point from the mean. For months, I toyed with this idea as a solution of correcting for non-stationary variance. However, in reality the contribution to the variance in intensity at a given pixel is down to both Poisson photon statistics and fluorophore movement. This combination of factors makes it very difficult to ascertain the amount by which the variance should be altered. I eventually abandoned my efforts to alter the variance like this in favor of the Robin Hood detrending algorithm (section 3.9) which includes correction for non-stationary variance as an intrinsic part of its detrending routine. 3.8 Caveats of fitting and smoothing approaches Both fitting and smoothing approaches to detrending have serious caveats. Fitting approaches assume that the fluorescence intensity decay has a certain form. Unpredictable issues such as cell movement mean that no particular decay form can be assumed. Smoothing methods do not perform well at the edges of time series that they are applied to. They also require the user to choose a smoothing parameter. The problem of how to best choose this parameter was solved recently (Nolan, Alvarez, et al. 2017), but this method has not been widely adopted. Most importantly, both fitting and smoothing fail when the data cannot be approximated as mathematically continuous (fitted and smoothed lines are continuous approximations of data). Fluorescence intensity data at low intensities—where most pixel values are either 0 or 1—are quasi-binary4 and hence a continuous approximation does not make sense (see figure 3.14). This means that neither fitting nor smoothing are applicable detrending methods at low intensities. This is the crucial caveat of these methods because, when bleaching is a problem, it is common to reduce laser power to reduce bleaching, which leads directly to lower intensity images. With fitting and smoothing techniques, it may sometimes be advisable to increase the laser power to achieve higher intensities such that the detrending routines will function properly. This means one may need to bleach more in order to be able to correct for bleaching. This farcical situation necessitates a new detrending technique which can function at low intensities. Figure 3.14: Left: for high (\\(\\gg 1\\)) intensity values, the line is a satisfactory approximation of the data, representing it well. Right: for low (quasi-binary) intensity values, the line is not a good approximation for the data and indeed no line or curve could represent the data well. 3.9 Robin Hood detrending Intensity images in units of photons are count data. This means that the values are all natural numbers, i.e. elements of \\(\\mathbb{N}_0=\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}\\). Fitting and smoothing give real-numbered values (elements of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)), which must then be transformed back into count data (elements of \\(\\mathbb{N}_0\\)), normally by rounding. This means that fitting and smoothing methods of detrending push values through \\(\\mathbb{N}_0 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}_0\\) (the move back \\(\\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}_0\\) is necessary because calculations like Quian and Elson’s moment analysis assume photon count data, which is necessarily in \\(\\mathbb{N}_0\\)). When current methods were failing to properly detrend low-intensity images, I began to wonder was it necessary to go through the real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), given that the start and end points were the natural numbers \\(\\mathbb{N}_0\\)? Consider figure 3.15. There is a bleached and unbleached version of an intensity trace. Suppose that our real data is the bleached trace, but we wish it looked like the unbleached trace. You may wonder why the unbleached trace is not at the starting intensity of the bleached series. For reasons that will become clear, the Robin Hood algorithm can only place the detrended image at the mean intensity of the original image. This is not a problem because the issue with bleaching in FCS and FFS is mainly that the changing signal leads to incorrect calculations, not that the loss in signal leads to a critical lack of information (photons). Indeed, a feature of the Robin Hood algorithm is that it preserves the mean intensity of the real data on a pixel-by pixel basis. Figure 3.15: Bleached and unbleached intensity traces. To get to the unbleached intensity trace from the bleached intensity trace, intensity must be subtracted from time-points with too much intensity and added to time points with too little intensity. This can be done by taking counts from frames with too much intensity and giving them to frames with too little intensity. In this way, no counts are gained or lost, they are just moved around the image series. See figure 3.16. Counts are passed from one frame to another along a given pixel, i.e. if a count is taken from pixel at position \\(p\\) in some frame \\(i\\), it must be given to a pixel at the same position \\(p\\) in some other frame \\(j\\). It is this condition that ensures that the mean intensity images of the original and detrended image series are the same. Figure 3.16: Robin Hood: counts are taken from frames of higher intensity (usually closer to the start of the image series) and given to frames of lower intensity (usually closer to the end of the image series). To determine how many swaps need to be made to detrend a given image series, equation (3.3) can be used, with \\(\\alpha\\) being the number of swaps. The random gifting of counts from higher to lower intensity frames has the effect of temporally redistributing mean intensity but also variance in intensity. With photon statistics (which follow a Poisson distribution), random counts provide both mean and variance. This is in contrast to all previous methods which consist of determining local deviation and adding it to a fixed global mean: this provides no temporal redistribution of variance. 3.10 A comparison of detrending methods To compare the various detrending methods, I use the following workflow: Simulate a number \\(N = 100,000\\) of particles diffusing with known diffusion rate. Simulations were done with the brownded software package (section 2.3.7). Simulate photon emission from these particles with chosen brightness \\(\\epsilon\\) and create an image series from this, being careful to (virtually) sample at a rate appropriate for number and brightness analysis. Bleach the simulation with a chosen constant bleaching rate.5 Simulate photon emission from the bleached simulation (bleached particles don’t emit photons) with the same brightness \\(\\epsilon\\) and create an image series. Detrend the bleached image series. Evaluate the detrending algorithm by measuring how close the brightness of the detrended bleached image series is to the known simulated brightness. For all combinations of brightnesses of \\(\\epsilon = 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10\\) and bleaching fractions of 0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 20 images of 64x64 pixels and 5,000 frames were simulated using 100,000 fluorescent diffusing particles.6 These were detrended with the following detrending routines:7 Boxcar with \\(l = 10\\) (boxcar10, the most common detrending routine). Exponential smoothing with automatically chosen parameter \\(\\tau\\) (autotau). Robin Hood with automatically chosen swaps (robinhood). The performance was evaluated using the mean relative error. Definition 3.6 For a given brightness and bleaching fraction, \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{mean relative error } = \\frac{|(\\text{calculated brightness after detrending}) - (\\text{true brightness})|}{(\\text{true brightness})} \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] Figure 3.17 shows the results. Before I discuss them, note that the common brightnesses that we see are in the range \\(\\epsilon = 0.003\\) to \\(\\epsilon = 0.1\\). Figure 3.17: A comparison of different detrending methods with various brightnesses and bleaching fractions (steady, constant-rate bleaching), including the results of not detrending at all. The most striking thing about figure 3.17 is that the best choice in all cases is to not detrend at all! This is an interesting result and seems to render all detrending routines worthless. However, when working with real data, not detrending does not work well at all. This will be shown in chapter 4. This indicated that my simulations are unrealistic. This is probably because with real data, bleaching is likely not taking place at a constant, steady rate and other factors such as cell movement or/and laser power fluctuations are contributing to medium and long term intensity fluctuations and these have a detrimental effect on calculations if not detrended out. It would be possible to study this by mimicking real bleaching profiles with simulations (see section 6.2). The worst performer by far is boxcar10. For example, at \\(\\epsilon = 0.1\\), it makes an error of worse than 40% and for \\(\\epsilon = 0.001, 0.01\\), its error is worse than 50%, so it does not even appear on the plot. This is good evidence that arbitrarily choosing the parameter \\(l\\) is very bad practice. For realistic brightnesses (\\(\\le 0.1\\)), robinhood is the best with errors almost always lower than 5%. autotau also performs very well, with errors almost always less than 10%. At the lowest brightness \\(\\epsilon = 0.001\\), all methods are somewhat erratic. That is because at this extremely low brightness, there is a critical lack of information (photons) for the algorithms to work with. Finally, at unrealistically high brightnesses of \\(\\epsilon = 1, 10\\), autotau begins to perform well because at these high photon counts, the caveats of smoothing have totally disappeared. However, I cannot explain the degradation in the performance of robinhood in this case. Fortunately, there is no need to dwell on this, as this situation (\\(\\epsilon = 1, 10\\)) does not arise in practice because available fluorophores are not this bright. References "],

This is something I would like to do. It would be difficult because it would require the collection and cataloging of a diverse set of real data bleaching profiles from various biological samples. This would be the bottleneck because I have already written the simulation and analysis pipelines. 6.3 Robin Hood for single point FCS Right now, Robin Hood works only for imaging FFS/FCS because it has a step where it uses the mean intensity of a frame. With single point, there are no frames to take the mean of. This problem can be overcome with the use of smoothing splines. I will work on this when the thesis work is done. 6.4 Robin Hood publication Once Robin Hood has been implemented in ImageJ and more realistic bleaching problems have been studied, Robin Hood should be published. 6.5 Revisit old N&amp;B data with new detrending algorithm Having claimed that Robin Hood detrending is significantly better than previous detrending methods, it makes sense to revisit old results found using old detrending methods to see how much they would be changed with the application of this new detrending algorithm. The main difficulty in such a project would be obtaining the old data. To this day, most microscopy publications do not have their associated images in a centralised repository, so the only way to get this data is to request it from the authors. 6.6 Compare FRET with FCS I have the idea that when the question “Do these proteins interact?” is answered by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET, Förster (1948)), it should also be answerable by FCS. I would like to try to reproduce some standard FRET results with FCS. I am particularly interested to find out if there are instances where one technique succeeds in detecting interaction and the other fails, and why this might be. For example, it might be possible that for a given interacting pair of proteins, it is impossible to label them such that the FRET couple is close enough for FRET to be detected, but that this interaction is detectable by FCS. These techniques have been compared before (Sahoo and Schwille 2011), but not by trying to reproduce previous work. In addition, attempts by new groups to reproduce work that is accepted in the literature are always interesting (Baker 2016). References "]
