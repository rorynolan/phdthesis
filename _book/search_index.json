As a test application of exponential smoothing detrending (section 3.6) with automatically chosen parameter \\(\\tau\\), we used it with number and brightness to verify this dimerization. We tested this in 20 Cos7 cells with mClover-labelled FKBP12. We found a brightness increase in \\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(\\approx 1.6\\)-fold using the automatic detrending method. The naiive choice of \\(\\tau=10\\) resulted in a \\(\\approx 0.7\\)-fold calculated increase, which is indeed a decrease. The \\(\\approx 1.6\\)-fold increase suggests that dimerization had occurred, however, we expected the increase to be \\(\\approx 2\\)-fold upon dimerization. In that publication (Nolan et al. 2017), we postulated that the 1.6 figure was due to the fact that not all of the protein had dimerized. Recently, a paper came out (Dunsing et al. 2018) explaining how the assumption that all fluorophores emit signal is invalid and that because of this, oligomeric state changes calculated from brightness must be adjusted by a correction factor specific to the fluorophore. Unfortunately, this study did not characterize mClover, so we do not know its correction factor. I suspect that applying this correction would bring our figure of 1.6 a lot closer to 2. The fact that the naive choice of \\(\\tau=10\\) gave a decrease in brightness shows that arbitrary parameter choices lead to unpredictable and unreliable results and should hence be avoided. 4.2 In vitro number and brightness In our research group, we believe that the most practical quantitative method for measuring homo-dimerization in vivo and in vitro is N&amp;B (Digman et al. 2008) because it is callibration-free and does not require specialised instrumentation. There are many examples of the application of N&amp;B in vivo (the original N&amp;B paper has over 250 citations, most of which are in vivo applications) but none in vitro. Hence, we published a protocol (Nolan et al. 2018) detailing how N&amp;B can be applied in vitro. This time, we used FKBP12F36V which is an FKBP mutant with a new dimerizing drug AP20187 (known coloquially as the BB dimerizer); this pair is designed to have better specificity than the original (Clackson et al. 1998). In this experiment, the FKBP12F36V was labelled with mVenus. We found that the brightness doubled from \\(\\epsilon = 0.005\\) to \\(\\epsilon = 0.010\\) upon addition of the drug. See figure 4.1. This analysis was done with exponential smoothing detrending with automatically chosen parameter \\(\\tau\\). Without detrending, the pre-BB brightness was calculated as \\(\\epsilon = 0.026\\), showing that detrending is absolutely necessary and that neglecting this step can lead to nonsensical results. Figure 4.1: Dimerization of FKBP12F36V upon BB addition is seen by a brightness doubling from \\(\\epsilon = 0.005\\) to \\(\\epsilon = 0.010\\) over a period of minutes. References "]
